       <strong>Sunil Pai</strong> has been a professional front end developer for 8 years. 
       He's cut his teeth on developing webapps and sites for startups, 
       design firms, the government, open source, and corporates. He's also a regular 
       speaker at HasGeek events, and chaired the programme committee for 
       JSFoo 2012. He currently runs his own firm, and thinks the world would be a better place 
       if we accepted the Postel Principle as common law.
